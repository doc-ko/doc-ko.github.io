This repository contains some of my technical writing pieces.

## [API Snippet](./portfolio/api-snippet)

This piece is a description of an OpenAPI specification.
It serves as an introduction to a REST API product.
It details authentication and error representation, and also discusses some noteworthy behaviours; for example, blank response fields are returned as `null`.

After this introduction, you would find a list of endpoints and their descriptions.

### Intended Audience

Included in [the document](./portfolio/api-snippet).
